# BrainBeats
The BrainBeats toolbox, implemented as an EEGLAB plugin, allows joint processing and analysis of EEG and cardiovascular signals (ECG/PPG). It has 3 main modes: 1) Remove heart components from EEG signals using ICA and ICLabel; 2) Perform heartbeat-evoked potentials (HEP) analysis; Extract EEG and HRV features from continuous data.
